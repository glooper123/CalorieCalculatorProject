# TDEE Calculator Project

What's up! 

This is my calorie/TDEE calculator. Use this to figure out how much calories you need to eat everyday to maintain your weight. If you want to lose weight, such as 1 pound a week, subtract 500 kcal from your TDEE calculation. Vice versa if you want to gain weight. 

Disclaimer: These may not be exactly accurate, so do your own research regarding the exact calories you need depending on your health goals, restrictions, etc. This is a rough estimate, like every other calorie calculator you will see on the vast web. Use this as an approximation and experiment with what works well. 

I'm with you on your fitness journey and I hope you reach your fitness goals :)

All the best, 
Ashwin
